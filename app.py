   ("What Is Chat Moderation?","Chat moderation is the practice of monitoring and managing online conversations to ensure they remain safe, respectful, and on-topic.\n\nAs a moderator, you are the first line of defense against harmful content. Your work directly impacts thousands of users every day.\n\n📌 KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:\n• Monitor live chat streams in real-time\n• Identify and remove policy-violating content\n• Issue warnings and bans to rule-breaking users\n• Escalate serious issues to senior staff immediately\n• Keep accurate records of all moderation actions\n\n💡 WHY IT MATTERS:\nResearch shows that 70% of users leave a platform permanently after experiencing harassment. Your role protects the community and keeps users engaged."),
   ("Community Guidelines","Every platform has its own community guidelines, but they share common themes.\n\n✅ GENERALLY ALLOWED:\n• Constructive criticism and respectful debate\n• Sharing personal experiences and opinions\n• Asking questions and seeking help\n\n❌ NOT ALLOWED:\n• Hate speech or discrimination\n• Harassment, bullying, or targeted attacks\n• Spam, self-promotion, or repetitive posting\n• Graphic violence or disturbing imagery\n• Doxxing — sharing private personal information\n\n📌 KEY PRINCIPLE — CONSISTENCY:\nApply rules the same way to every user, regardless of their status or popularity.\n\n💡 PRO TIP: When unsure whether content violates guidelines, ask: 'Would this make another user feel unsafe or unwelcome?' If yes, it likely warrants action."),
   ("Handling Difficult Users","Not every user you deal with will be cooperative.\n\n😤 TYPES OF DIFFICULT USERS:\n• The Arguer — disputes every moderation action\n• The Rule-Pusher — constantly tests boundaries\n• The Evader — creates new accounts to avoid bans\n• The Harasser — targets specific users or moderators\n\n🛠️ PROVEN STRATEGIES:\n1. STAY CALM — Never respond emotionally.\n2. WARN FIRST — Give a clear, specific warning before action.\n3. DOCUMENT — Screenshot and log all incidents.\n4. BE CONSISTENT — Apply rules the same way every time.\n5. ESCALATE — Know when and how to escalate.\n\n⚠️ REMEMBER: You enforce platform rules, not your personal opinions."),
   ("Escalation Procedures","Knowing when and how to escalate is one of the most critical moderation skills.\n\n🚨 ALWAYS ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY FOR:\n• Any threats of violence or self-harm\n• Illegal content (CSAM, terrorism, fraud)\n• Coordinated harassment campaigns\n• Any situation where you feel uncertain\n\n📋 HOW TO ESCALATE:\n1. DO NOT delete content before escalating — it is evidence\n2. Screenshot with timestamps visible\n3. Note the username, user ID, and post URL\n4. Use the designated escalation channel\n5. Write a clear, factual summary\n\n💡 GOLDEN RULE: When in doubt, escalate. Always better to escalate unnecessarily than miss a serious incident."),
